    "This challenge problem is focused on synthesizing planar linkage mechanisms such that a specific output curve is traced using the mechanism. For this project you are tasked with synthesizing linkage mechanisms to trace 20 different output shapes. Further you are tasked with synthesizing mechanisms such that the total material used for the mechanisms in minimized. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The first portion of this notebook will help you understand the linkage design problem and the way we parameterize each linkage design. In the second half of this notebook we provide you with a working implementation that you can use as a baseline. We also provide numerous helper functions in the linkage_utils. We will explain what these functions do and how to use them throughout this notebook. \n",

    "### Mechanism Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we expect you to represent planar mechanisms using the following components:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li><b>Adjacency/Connectivity Matrix: </b>A linkage mechanisms structure can be represented using a matrix of connectivity (C), which is similar to the adjacency matrix in graphs. The connectivity matrix for a mechanisms with $N$ nodes is a symmetric $N\\times N$ matrix with each row and column representing each node and its connections to other nodes. Take the example below:\n",

    "\n",
    "For Node A we use the first row/column of the matrix and we see that A is connected to B (which is represented by the second row/column). To represent this connection in the connectivity matrix we will set the value of the $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$ elements of the matrix to be 1. Similarly any time any nodes $i$ and $j$ are connected we set the value of the $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$ elements to be 1 and 0 if the nodes are not connected.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Node Types: </b>To define the mechanism we must also know which nodes are fixed (or ground nodes). For this purpose we store the list of  ground nodes' numbers.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Motor: </b>To simulate the kinematics of the mechanism we also need to know which linkage is driven (i.e., has the motor attached to it). For this purpose we store the numbers of the two nodes that the driven linkage is connected to.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Initial Positions: </b>Finally, we need to know the initial positions of the nodes that make up the mechanism. For this we store the $x,y$ positions of the nodes in a list. Note that all node positions must be floating point numbers between 0 and 1 (i.e., The initial positions of the mechanism must fit into a box of 1x1).</li>\n",

    "### Setting up Multi-Objective Optimization With Constraints Using Pymoo\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have established the details to the project lets setup the problem in Pymoo and run an example. Here we will also discuss how your submissions are going to be evaluated to get your final score.\n",
    "\n",
    "To setup the problem within Pymoo we will have to come up with a 1D representation of the mechanisms. We have already done that. However, we can make things a little more efficient as we know the connectivity matrix is symmetric and has a diagonal equal to zero, so instead of having the optimization come up with the whole connectivity matrix we will only have it come up with the upper triangular half of the matrix (Not including the diagonal). This means the algorithm has to come up with $\\frac{N^2-N}{2}$ 0s or 1s (i.e., booleans) to construct the adjacency matrix. But we can further simplify the process by starting from a motor and having the optimization build the rest of the mechanism, removing the need for the optimization to determine the motor as well as reducing the number of 0s and 1s in the upper triangular portion by one (Saving 3 parameters in the representation). To do this we will start with the following mechanism (<b>The random generator also does this by default!</b>):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/mGywWgr/start.jpg\" alt=\"start\" border=\"0\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We set Node 0 to ground and Node 1 to be ordinary and the motor to be <code>[0,1]</code>. Now we know that the upper triangular portion of the connectivity matrix starts with:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/5RqKYQN/upper-triangular-fromstart.jpg\" alt=\"upper-triangular-fromstart\" border=\"0\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before we also now know the types of the first two nodes which saves another two parameters from the optimization. At this point we will have the same representation as we have before, but with fewer numbers and no motor or N (size of mechanisms) as we generate the mechanism to have a certain size.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/gv2D0Y5/Optimization-Represenation.png\" alt=\"Optimization-Represenation\" border=\"0\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how to represent mechanisms for optimization (<b>actually this is a naive representation - you can think about how to improve this</b>) we will setup our problem with this many parameters. But note that the types of parameters are different. So we also have to tell Pymoo to treat them as the correct types of parameters (for C we need 0 or 1 (Boolean), for x0 we need real numbers (floating point), for node types we need 0 or 1 (Boolean), and for target we need an Integer). We do this by creating a mask (a list of parameter types with the same length as the parameters numbers), while also specifying the lower and upper limits of each parameter separately (by again creating two lists (with the same length as the number of parameters in the representation) with one holding the lower and the other holding the upper limit on the parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, don't forget that we need to also have our constraints in mind. In this representation, you control the size directly. For the chamfer distance and material, however, we have to let Pymoo know what our constraints are. Inequality constraints can be set in Pymoo (See: [constraints in pymoo](https://www.pymoo.org/misc/constraints.html?highlight=const)) as less than or equal to zero constraints. We will set the two constraints on chamfer distance and material use in our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "So based on this lets get started with defining the problem in Pymoo. \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "        <code>__init__</code>: Pymoo expects a datatype as well as lower and upper bound for each \"gene\" (parameter in our parameterization). In practice, we will pass Pymoo a vector of upper bounds <code>xu</code> and lower bounds <code>xl</code> as well as a vector of datatypes <code>self.mask</code>. We need to differentiate between datatypes because crossover, sampling, and mutation will happen slightly differently based on datatype.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "<code>construct_mechanism</code>: Converts from our flattened 1D representation to usable design info. This function is relatively long and boring, but you will need to update it if you change the way you parameterize mechanisms.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "<code>get_1D_representation</code>: Converts from usable design info to 1D representation. Again, you will need to update it if you change the way you parameterize mechanisms.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "<code>_evaluate</code>: Next, we define the evaluation function. We construct and solve the mechanism using <code>construct_mechanism</code> and the given helper functions. If the mechanism is locking or over/underdefined, we set the objective scores to infinity. We then normalize, rasterize, calculate the bidirectional chamfer distance to the target, and evaluate the material usage. This will give us our two scoring objectives for this particular mechanism.\n",
