## Linkage Synthesis Challenge Problem

This challenge problem is focused on synthesizing planar linkage mechanisms such that a specific output curve is traced using the mechanism. For this project you are tasked with synthesizing linkage mechanisms to trace 20 different output shapes. Further you are tasked with synthesizing mechanisms such that the total material used for the mechanisms in minimized.

## Requirements For Python
<ul>
<li>Python >= 3.8</li>
<li>numpy</li>
<li>pymoo >= 0.5</li>
<li>matplotlib</li>
<li>scipy</li>
<li>scikit-learn</li>
</ul>


Run:
```
conda create -n <environment-name> --file requirements.txt
```

to make the correct enivronment in conda

## Codes
```
Main.ipynb --- main codes for parallelization, fine tuning and custom mutation algorithm (better run on a CPU cluster with memory > 100G) </li>
```
